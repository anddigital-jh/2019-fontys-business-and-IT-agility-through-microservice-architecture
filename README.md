# 2019-fontys-business-and-IT-agility-through-microservice-architecture
Business and IT agility through microservice architecture powered by containers and cloud  Evolving architectures, emerging technology and new cloud services enable new ways to address business challenges with IT solutions. Microservices architecture promises flexibility, scalability, and optimal use of compute resources. This lecture introduces the objectives that microservices are expected to realize and explains how microservices will do that. The lecture describes the key concepts – domain driven design, bounded context, events, statelessness and APIs. It discusses and demonstrates a real implementation of microservices using containers and Kubernetes.   Students will do a hands-on with the Kubernetes platform – learning about the container orchestration features that allow microservices to be deployed, scaled, configured, failed over, and upgraded to new versions while maintaining proper routing and load balancing. Students will learn how to make use of Kubernetes for running multiple interacting containers executing applications written in the technology of their choice.  The lectures discusses the service mesh and challenges with tracing and end to end monitoring. The relevance of events for decoupled collaboration is discussed and demonstrated. Concepts discussed include workflow choreography, the CQRS data(base) pattern for cross domain data sharing and serverless architecture.
